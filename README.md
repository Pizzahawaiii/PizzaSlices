## Features

PizzaSlices lets you create custom rings, fill them with various types of actions and bind them to different keys. It doesn't reuse any of your existing action buttons so you won't lose any of that precious action bar space.

### Raid Marks

Assign any raid marks quickly and easily with the press of a single button, not matter if you're in a group/raid or using [SoloRaidTargetIcons](https://github.com/refaim/SoloRaidTargetIcons) There's also a special action to instantly clear all previously assigned raid marks.
