## Features

PizzaSlices lets you create custom rings, fill them with various types of actions and bind them to different keys. It doesn't reuse any of your existing action buttons so you won't lose any of that precious action bar space.

### Raid Marks

Assign any raid marks quickly and easily with the press of a single button, no matter if you're using [SoloRaidTargetIcons](https://github.com/refaim/SoloRaidTargetIcons) or in a group/raid. There's also a special action to instantly clear all previously assigned raid marks.

### Abilities

You can add all your active abilities to rings. Buffs, auras, hunter aspects, or even damage and healing abilities if you really want to - go crazy!

### Mounts
